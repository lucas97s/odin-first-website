# odin-first-website
Making a website from scratch.

This would be my first ever website creation. Reminder to commit each changes that is being mad. 

The strategy to create the website : 
1. Break the problem into its respective parts. 
2. Tackle each section. It seems like there are 4 section with a footer. 
3. Make sure to commit early and often. Make it a practice to do so.
